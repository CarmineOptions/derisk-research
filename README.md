# DeRisk Starknet

## Projects overview
This project consist of a monorepo with components required for the implementation of DeRisk on Starknet.
There are several components in this repository, each with its own purpose and functionality. The main components are:

### Shared
[`shared`](./apps/shared/README.md)
Both projects [`data_handler`](./apps/data_handler/README.md), [`dashboard_app`](./apps/dashboard_app/README.md)  work with the same shared database,
which is contained in the shared folder. It also contains all shared modules.

### Data Handler
[`data_handler`](./apps/data_handler/README.md)
Data processing and analysis component: Collects data from DeFi, analyzes it, and saves it to the db. It contains Celery tasks to schedule data collection runs. Once the data is collected, it triggers an endpoint on the `dashboard_app`

### Dashboard App 
[`dashboard_app`](./apps/dashboard_app/README.md)
Works as a server for the [`frontend_dashboard`](./apps/frontend_dashboard/README.md). Generates an analytics dashboard using Streamlit. Contains an API to handle the Telegram webhook and send bot messages.
Key Features:
- Interactive data visualization
- Protocol statistics monitoring
- Loan portfolio analysis
- Real-time data updates


### Dashboard Frontend 
[`frontend_dashboard`](./apps/frontend_dashboard/README.md)
React client app. Uses API if the  [`dashboard_app`](./apps/dashboard_app/README.md)


### Outdated and about to be removed
- [`web_app`](./apps/web_app/README.md) - Main web application interface
- [`legacy_app`](./apps/legacy_app/README.md) - Legacy application functionality



## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine (v19.03+ recommended).
- Docker Compose installed (v2.0+ recommended).

### Data Handler Local Development

1. To set up this project run next command for local development in `derisk-research` directory:

2. Environment Configuration:
```bash
cp apps/data_handler/.env.dev apps/data_handler/.env
```
3. Start the Services:

```bash
docker-compose -f devops/dev/docker-compose.data-handler.yaml up --build
```
4. Stop the Services:
```bash
docker-compose -f devops/dev/docker-compose.data-handler.yaml down
```

5. To run test cases for this project run next command in `derisk-research` directory:
```bash
make test_data_handler
```

For detailed documentation, see the [Data Handler](./apps/data_handler/README.md)




### Dashboard App Running Locally
1. To set up this project run next command for local development in `derisk-research` directory:

2. Environment Configuration:
```bash
cp apps/dashboard_app/.env.dev apps/dashboard_app/.env
```
3. Start the Services:

```bash
docker-compose -f devops/dev/docker-compose.dashboard-app.yaml up --build
```
4. Stop the Services:
```bash
docker-compose -f devops/dev/docker-compose.dashboard-app.yaml down
```

#### Backend API (FastAPI)

```bash
cd apps/dashboard_app
poetry install
cp .env.dev .env  
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Explore the API will be available at http://localhost:8000/docs. 

#### Frontend App (React + Vite)

Make sure `dashboard_app` is running!

```bash
cd apps/frontend_dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5173 to access the subscription form.

#### CORS & Proxy
The backend is configured with CORS to allow requests from http://localhost:5173, and the Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the backend.

## Shared package (Common code shared between the components)
1. How to run test cases for shared package, run next command in root folder:
```bash
make test_shared
```

## Running the dashboard frontend with Docker
