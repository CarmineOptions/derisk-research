# Contributor Guidelines

1. Task Claiming
    - Comment: 'I would like to take this task, I love orange' including the estimated delivery timeline (start and completion dates) and a brief summary of relevant skills (required for complex tasks). Make sure, that you start with comment which is provided with secret phrase, otherwise your application will be ignored.
    - Join the contributors' Telegram group for updates and discussions.
2. Task Assignment
    - Easy tasks: Assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. No further assignment is required.
    - Medium and Complex tasks: Prospective assignees must outline their approach to the task. Assignments will be based on these proposals to ensure optimal match and prioritization. The higher the complexity of the task, the more detailed description of the approach is needed.
4. Initial Commit Requirement
    - If no commits are made or the assignee is unreachable within `10` hours post-assignment, we reserve the right to reassign the task.
    - We also reserve the right to reassign tasks if it becomes clear they cannot be completed by the hackathon's end.
5. Submission Guidelines
    - Submit a pull request (PR) from the forked repository.
    - Ensure to rebase on the current master branch before creating the PR.
6. Resolve issue in your PR
 - after review, you have 12 hours to fix it, exception, if you have a lot you can push just partially if you have `medium` or `complex` task
 - If you couldn't do that, you will be unassign.
